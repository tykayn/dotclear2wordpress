#Dotclear Importer

Migrate your DC2 blog to Wordpress.

use __bower install__ to init the project

currently, this moves only the posts and it doesn't rewrite already exported posts, in case you double import them.
if you have a multi dotclear blog you can only migrate one at a time.

comments, categories, and tags are planned to be migrated also someday.
Feel free to use it and improve it :)
